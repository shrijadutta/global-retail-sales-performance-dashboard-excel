## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global retail sales data using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to identify key trends, patterns, and actionable insights through pivot tables, charts, and summary statistics.

## Data Source
The dataset used is `merch_sales.csv`, sourced from Kaggle. It contains transactional-level details of sales made by the company, including revenue, product categories, customer demographics, and locations.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Power Pivot – DAX)

## Data Preparation
- Loaded the `merch_sales.csv` file into Excel.
- Used a DAX formula to group customers into age brackets for easier demographic analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Domestic vs International Sales
Domestic sales outperformed international sales overall, indicating a stronger market presence locally.

### 2. Monthly Revenue Trend  
**Insights:**  
- **May ($80,704)** and **July ($77,459)** recorded the highest revenue, suggesting strong mid-year sales performance.  
- **December** and **March** showed healthy spikes, likely due to seasonal trends.  
- A sharp drop in **November 2024** is attributed to incomplete data — needs further verification.

The trend shows relative consistency, with monthly revenues mostly between **$64K and $73K**.

### 3. Month-on-Month % Revenue Change
A waterfall chart visualizes month-to-month percentage changes in sales from November 2023 to November 2024.  
Key highlights:
- Strong growth: +17.12% (Nov → Dec 2023), +17.10% (Jun → Jul 2024)  
- Notable declines: −18.04% (May → Jun 2024), −16.15% (Jul → Aug 2024), mainly due to reduced clothing sales  
- Sharp drop: −86.08% in November 2024 due to incomplete data
  
Overall, the chart illustrates sales volatility, category-level impacts, and seasonal trends.

### 4. Revenue by Product Category
- **Clothing** was the top-performing category.
- Other categories contributed less significantly to total revenue.

### 5. Top & Bottom 5 Products by Revenue and Quantity
- Generated lists of best- and worst-performing products based on total revenue and units sold.

### 6. Top 5 Cities by Revenue
**Sydney** recorded the highest revenue, followed by **San Francisco**, **New Jersey**, **Mumbai**, and **Sacramento** — highlighting the strong economic performance of these key urban centers.

### 7. Revenue by Age Bracket
The analysis indicates that individuals aged **21–25** contributed the highest revenue, followed closely by those in the **31–35** and **26–30** age groups.

### 8. Customer Rating Analysis
Nearly **60%** of customers rated the products **4 or 5 stars**, indicating a generally positive customer experience.  
The **average rating** across all reviews was **3.5 stars**.
